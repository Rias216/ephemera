# ✦ Ephemera

> What vanishes may still illuminate.

Ephemera is a compact reasoning harness with a native terminal interface. It
keeps model deliberation private, applies a provider-neutral reasoning contract,
and returns dense, useful answers through a rose-lit Bubble Tea TUI.

## Features

- Native Go TUI using Bubble Tea, Bubbles, Lip Gloss, and Glamour
- Rose-pink dark theme (`#FF69B4` / `#DB2777`) plus monochrome mode
- OpenCode-style command palette and autocomplete
- Guided `/connect` flow with masked API-key input
- Native Ollama, OpenAI, and Anthropic providers
- Any OpenAI-compatible API, including local servers
- Named JSON sessions with automatic persistence
- Normal, deep-reason, concise, and creative reasoning modes
- Scrollable Markdown answers and mouse-wheel support
- Clipboard copy through `/copy` or `Ctrl+Y`
- Single Windows launcher that resolves modules, compiles, and runs
- One static binary when built with `make static`

## Requirements

- Go 1.22.8 or newer
- A terminal with ANSI color support
- One model provider:
  - Ollama running locally
  - OpenAI
  - Anthropic
  - An OpenAI-compatible endpoint

The project is pure Go. `requirements.txt` intentionally contains no Python
dependencies.

## Windows: one-click compile and run

Open the project folder and double-click:

```text
run.bat
```

From PowerShell or Command Prompt, arguments are passed through to Ephemera:

```powershell
.\run.bat --session architecture-notes
.\run.bat --provider ollama --model qwen3:8b
```

`run.bat` performs these steps:

1. checks that Go is available,
2. runs `go mod tidy` when `go.sum` is missing,
3. builds `bin\ephemera.exe`,
4. launches the compiled executable.

## Linux and macOS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ephemera-ai/ephemera.git
cd ephemera
go mod tidy
make build
./bin/ephemera
```

Without `make`:

```bash
mkdir -p bin
go build -trimpath -ldflags "-s -w -X main.version=dev" -o bin/ephemera ./cmd/ephemera
./bin/ephemera
```

Build a stripped, CGO-free binary:

```bash
make static VERSION=0.1.0
```

## Command autocomplete

Type `/` to open the command palette.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Tab` | Complete the selected command or value |
| `↑` / `↓` | Move through suggestions |
| `Enter` | Execute the current input or activate the highlighted suggestion |
| `Esc` | Cancel the `/connect` wizard |

Autocomplete also suggests:

- provider names and known compatible presets for `/connect`,
- provider names for `/provider`,
- reasoning modes for `/mode`,
- themes for `/theme`,
- saved session names for `/load`,
- live provider models, current model, and curated fallback models for `/model`,
- common OpenAI-compatible endpoints during `/connect`.

## Connect from inside the TUI

Run the guided wizard:

```text
/connect
```

Or begin with a provider already selected:

```text
/connect ollama
/connect openai
/connect anthropic
/connect compatible
/connect openrouter
/connect groq
/connect nvidia
```

The wizard asks only for the fields the selected provider needs.

### Ollama

```text
/connect ollama
Ollama URL: http://localhost:11434
Model: qwen3:8b
```

### OpenAI

```text
/connect openai
API key: ********
Model: your-model-id
```

Press Enter on the API-key step to use `OPENAI_API_KEY` when it is already set.

### Anthropic

```text
/connect anthropic
API key: ********
Model: your-model-id
```

Press Enter on the API-key step to use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` when it is already
set.

### Any OpenAI-compatible provider

Use `compatible` for custom providers and local servers exposing the standard
`/chat/completions` API:

```text
/connect compatible
Connection name: openrouter
Base URL: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
API key: ********
Model: provider/model-id
```

Known presets such as `openrouter`, `groq`, `nvidia`, `together`, and
`lm-studio` prefill the matching base URL while still storing the runtime
provider as `compatible`. The wizard also accepts any custom HTTP or HTTPS base
URL.

API keys entered in `/connect` are masked and kept only in process memory. They
are never written to `config.json`. For persistent credentials, set:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
EPHEMERA_API_KEY
```

Non-secret connection metadata such as base URLs, provider names, and model IDs
is persisted.

## Commands

```text
/connect [ollama|openai|anthropic|compatible|openrouter|groq|nvidia|together|lm-studio]
/help
/clear
/new [name]
/save [name]
/load <name>
/sessions
/provider <ollama|openai|anthropic|compatible>
/model <model-id>
/models
/mode <normal|deep-reason|concise|creative>
/theme <rose|mono>
/copy
/quit
```

## General keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | Send a prompt or run a command |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Scroll the transcript |
| `Ctrl+U` / `Ctrl+D` | Half-page scroll |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Copy the last answer |
| `Ctrl+C` | Save and quit |

## Startup flags

Open or create a named session:

```bash
ephemera --session architecture-notes
```

Override settings:

```bash
ephemera \
  --provider anthropic \
  --model your-model-id \
  --mode deep-reason \
  --session compiler-design
```

## Persistence

Ephemera uses the platform user config directory:

- Linux: `~/.config/ephemera/`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ephemera/`
- Windows: `%AppData%\ephemera\`

Files:

```text
config.json
sessions/<session-name>.json
```

Runtime API keys are excluded from serialized configuration.

## Reasoning design

The harness instructs the selected model to:

1. identify objectives and constraints,
2. compare approaches,
3. test assumptions and edge cases,
4. critique and repair its draft,
5. return only the smallest complete final answer.

Private chain-of-thought is neither requested for display nor stored separately.
Anthropic thinking blocks are ignored; only final text enters the transcript.

## Development

```bash
make fmt
make vet
make test
make run
```

On Windows without `make`:

```powershell
gofmt -w .
go vet ./...
go test ./...
go run .\cmd\ephemera
```

## Static binary notes

`CGO_ENABLED=0` produces a self-contained executable. Clipboard integration is
best-effort and depends on facilities available on the host desktop or terminal
session; Ephemera reports a non-fatal status message when copying is unavailable.
